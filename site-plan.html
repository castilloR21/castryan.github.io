      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Do you think sharks are all scary sea creatures? Would you be surprised to know that most shark species are less than 7 feet long?
        My website will be informative about sharks and show the unique spectrum of these deep-sea fish. 
        I will talk about the most infamous ones, such as the great white and tiger shark, but I will also show the more docile creatures that most people donâ€™t know about. 
        This website will be a helpful resource to properly inform people about the nature of sharks. </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is for those who are not well-learned about shark concepts and facts.
          It will be beneficial to those with irrational fears and inflated views of sharks such as the Great White shark.
          Fun facts will be used to entertain with unique information on things such as unusual sharks or interesting records.
          The fun facts page is meant to be the most accessible part of the website having more open appeal toward regular viewers.
          If they do not find "The Big Deal" very interesting, the fun facts pages will be more satisfying to read.

        Sharks: The big fish of the sea. However, not all sharks are the same. There's a lot of sharks out there, but lets get the simple facts straight.
        Sharks can be identified by their gill count of 5-7 slits and their skeleton which is made of cartilage. With more than 500 known shark species, 
        there are many unique (shark) fish in the sea. However, when you think shark, you think of the shark attacks on humans. This has caused an irrational
        fear of sharks and have been conceived as monsters of the ocean but they aren't nearly as dangerous as they are portayed in movies and media. So let's
        find out why that's a load of bull shark (a shark that actually has some of the highest attack counts)!

      <h3>The Big Deal</h3>
      <p>
        So, what is the big deal? Sharks commonly have been overblown in their threat to humans in the water. Everyone thinks of the most dangerous
        predators: Great White, Tiger, Oceanic Whitetip, and Bull sharks. These specific sharks have had the most unprovoked attacks out of any shark. However, the amount
        of attacks per year is very small, with fatal ones even smaller. Around 60 global shark attacks are reported every year, with 5 of them fatal. In comparison,
        about 100 million sharks are killed every year. Shark attacks themselves have been declining overtime while shark hunting has been consistently high.
        </p>
      <p>
        What are considered the sources of the overblown fear of sharks are the <i>Jaws</i> films and the infamous Jersey Shore attacks of 1916. 
        Public media is considered an influence of many public overreactions and exaggerations and sharks are not different. You are more likely to
        killed by a dog or struck by lightning than even getting attacked by these predators. Humans aren't a primary part of their diets and most attacks
        are speculated to be the shark accidently thinking a human was another animal, like a seal when on a surfboard.

      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <p>
        There are many fascinating aspects of the shark species to know. Lets take a look at these interesting facts:
      
        <li>The largest shark, the Whale Shark, can grow up to 61 feet long!</li>
        <li>The Basking shark, the second largest shark, has the biggest jaw at 3 feet wide!</li>
        <li>The Cookiecutter shark's mouth has suction and creates a "cookie" shaped bite out of what it attached to. This fish's appetite
          ranges from dolphins to submarines!
        </li>
        <li>The Oceanic Whitetip shark is responsible for attacking many shipwrecks. While it's considered to have one of the highest
          kill counts of any shark, most of the attacks are unrecorded.
        </li>
        <li>The smallest shark is the Dwarf lanternshark, smaller than a human hand at 7 inches.</li>
        <li>There has been much debate on what is the largest great white shark recorded. Up until the internet and better technology,
          newspaper articles and claims were all people had to go on. Going as far back as the 1870s, there have been claims of white sharks
          reaching from 21 feet to a whopping 37 feet long! Much of these claims are criticized for the legitimacy and scientific accuracy of
          these claims, many of which are considered overblown.
        </li>
        <li>The Thresher shark uses its very long tail as a weapon to stun prey.</li>
        <li>The Shortfin Mako, the fastest shark, can swim up to 31 mph!</li>
