        So, what is the big deal? Sharks commonly have been overblown in their threat to humans in the water. Everyone thinks of the most dangerous
        predators: Great White, Tiger, Oceanic Whitetip, and Bull sharks. These specific sharks have had the most unprovoked attacks out of any shark. However, the amount
        of attacks per year is very small, with fatal ones even smaller. Around 60 global shark attacks are reported every year, with 5 of them fatal. In comparison,
        about 100 million sharks are killed every year. Shark attacks themselves have been declining overtime while shark hunting has been consistently high.
        </p>
      <p>
        What are considered the sources of the overblown fear of sharks are the <i>Jaws</i> films and the infamous Jersey Shore attacks of 1916. 
        Public media is considered an influence of many public overreactions and exaggerations and sharks are not different. You are more likely to
        killed by a dog or struck by lightning than even getting attacked by these predators. Humans aren't a primary part of their diets and most attacks
        are speculated to be the shark accidently thinking a human was another animal, like a seal when on a surfboard.
